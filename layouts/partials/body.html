        <p>I’m a software and infrastructure engineer who enjoys building, breaking, and simplifying complex systems. By profession, I work in DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering, spending most of my time around cloud infrastructure, automation, Kubernetes, and the operational side of large-scale systems.</p>
        <p>Over the years, I’ve worked across fintech, AI, and enterprise environments, helping teams migrate monolithic systems to microservices, build reliable CI/CD pipelines, and run production workloads at scale. I’m particularly interested in the intersection of infrastructure and machine learning how AI systems are built, deployed, and operated in the real world.</p>
        <p>Outside of my day job, I’m a part-time trader, exploring the stock market as a hobby. I’m less interested in prediction and more in understanding market behavior, risk, and the psychology behind decision-making. For me, trading is another form of systems thinking observing patterns, constraints, and failures over time.</p>
        <p>I like tinkering trying tools, writing small scripts, automating things that probably don’t need automation, and occasionally breaking systems just to understand how they fail. This website is a personal space where I document ideas, experiments, and things I learn along the way.
            I currently live and work in Abu Dhabi.</p>
